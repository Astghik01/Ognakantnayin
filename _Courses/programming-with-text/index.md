This course focuses on programming strategies and techniques behind procedural analysis and generation of text-based data.

We'll explore topics ranging from evaluating text according to its statistical properties to the automated production of text with probabilistic methods to text visualization.
Students will learn server-side and client-side JavaScript programming and develop projects that can be shared and interacted with online.

There will be weekly homework assignments as well as a final project.
