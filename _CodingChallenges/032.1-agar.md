In this coding challenge, I create a clone of the multiplayer online game Agar.io using JavaScript (p5.js). This is only the beginning of this challenge where I build out the basic game mechanics. I plan to make a follow-up to this video and add the multiplayer functionality of the game using node.js and websockets.
