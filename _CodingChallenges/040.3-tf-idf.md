In part 3 of the Word Counting coding challenge, I implement an algorithm known as TF-IDF (Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency).  The algorithm scores each word's relevance for a given document based on its frequency in one document relative to all others in a corpus.  This is one possible methods for keyword generation.
