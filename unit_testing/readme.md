This directory is for unit testing, which should insure that all pull requests have valid files.
Each file in the form scriptname.test.js will be run by [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html), a node based
unit testing library created by facebook. To understand what unit testing does check out
